This is for me to automate setting up new dev environments. But
feel free to clone this repo and follow the instructions below
if you want my setup. *macOS only*.

### Install
```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

./install.sh ~
```
### Notes
1. When FZF installs enter `no` when prompted to update shell config files -- they're already
   configured.
2. Don't switch to Oh My Zsh until install is complete.
